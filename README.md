### Gameplay Mechanics
The game features a turn-based combat system where multiple players control tanks on dynamically generated terrain. Key gameplay elements include:

1. **Terrain Interaction**
  - Procedurally generated and smoothed terrain from text-based layout files
  - Destructible terrain with realistic falling mechanics
  - Dynamic tree positioning that adapts to terrain changes

2. **Tank Controls**
  - Precise turret angle control
  - Terrain-based movement
  - Limited fuel management
  - Power level adjustment for projectile trajectory

3. **Physics Simulation**
  - Gravity-based projectile movement
  - Wind effects influencing projectile trajectory
  - Realistic explosion mechanics with damage calculation based on proximity

## Game Features
